Hey there, welcome to my "Now" page! Hereâ€™s the scoop on what Iâ€™m up to:

**ðŸŒŸ Learning:**

- Currently cracking the code with Python on Scrimba.
- Rediscovering the joys of math with "Challenge and Thrill of Pre-College Mathematics" book. 

**ðŸ“š Reading:**

- Totally immersed in "This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends" by Nicole Perlroth. Itâ€™s like a spy novel, but scarier!
