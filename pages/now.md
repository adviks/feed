Hey there, welcome to my "Now" page! Here’s the scoop on what I’m up to:

**Learning:**

- Currently cracking the code with Python on Scrimba.
- Rediscovering the joys of math with "Challenge and Thrill of Pre-College Mathematics" book. 

**Reading:**

- Totally immersed in "This Is How They Tell Me the World Ends" by Nicole Perlroth. It’s like a spy novel, but scarier!
