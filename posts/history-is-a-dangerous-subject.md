History can be a bit of a tricky subject, especially when it falls into the hands of politicians. We all know that history is biased, and that's just natural. Depending on who's telling the story, it can get a little skewed. For instance, if a European is telling their version of history, they're likely to make Europe look like the greatest thing since sliced bread. On the other hand, if a Turkish person is telling their view of history, you can bet they'll make the Turkish empire sound like the most amazing thing ever.

And let's not even get started on religion and caste - those topics can bring out some seriously strong biases. Someone might use history to bash an entire group of people or promote one particular race, religion, or caste. It's dangerous stuff.

The worst part is when politicians get their hands on history. They can twist things around to suit their own agenda, even if it means causing chaos in the present day. Sometimes, they'll even make stuff up just to win votes!

Even what we learn in school can be influenced by the government. They can make someone seem like a hero or a villain depending on what they want us to believe. It's no wonder kids can get brainwashed into hating certain groups of people.

All that said, I still think history is worth studying. Sure, it's full of lies, but it's important to understand how those lies came about and how they affected people. And hey, if nothing else, it'll help you pass your exams!
