In this day and age of the internet, we're bombarded with informationâ€”day in and day out. From social media to streaming platforms to news channels and all, everything is throwing at us information of a scale that we can't comprehend. We're overwhelmed.



Information filtering has become an important idea for sensible people. Most of the information is junk. We need to find a way to filter information, whether that is in the form of text, videos, or audio.



I have this idea of an app that takes in content from various platforms like YouTube, Twitter, news websites, podcasts, blogs, etc. and presents to you all of that in a feed that is catered specifically for you. You can read, watch, or listen to it whenever you feel fit.



Personally, I feel the short-form content is the problem. It messes up our attention span. Watching 30 videos of 30 seconds does us more harm to our attention span than one long video of 15 minutes. The same is the case with texts and audios.



However, as of now, this is just an idea. I need to chew on this a little more. This is my personal problem, but it might also be a problem for everybody else. So, I need to chew on this. I'll update you if I ever work on this.
