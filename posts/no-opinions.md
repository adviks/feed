In the age of social media and wokeness, it has become imperative to have an opinion on everything. Sometimes, it's okay to have opinions on things that we really want to have opinions on, but often it comes as an obligation to have opinions on everything that is happening on the globe.



I think it's okay to have no opinion at allâ€”stop being a judge for a while and stop seeing things/events from the lens of right or wrong, or good or bad. Simply observe things as they are without making any judgments.



Enjoy the bliss and peace that comes when you don't have opinions about everything. If you need to have an opinion, be selective. Don't have opinions on everything.
