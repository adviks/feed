I haven't posted in the past 2 years (almost). This is kind of funny, because I did write a post titled "No Opinions". In that post I talked about it's OK to not have opinions on everything. I guess, I took it to my heart, and stopped having, let alone opinions, even the thoughts.



Well, I overhauled the blog once again. On the front-end, it's wears the same minimalist design, but a lot has changed behind the curtains. I think I (might) keep this setting for a long while.



I have start reading books, once again. So, in the next coming days, I'll be talking a lot about books.
