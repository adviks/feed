I haven't posted in the past 2 years (almost). This is kind of funny, because I did write a post titled "No Opinions", in which I talked about it's OK to not have opinion on everything. I guess, I took it to my heart, and stopped having, let alone opinions, even the thoughts. 

Well, I overhauled the blog once again. On the frontend, it's wears the same minimalist design, but a lot has changed behind the curtains. I think I (might) keep this setting for a long while.
